Description: The package provides functions that model non-stationary extreme values
  using univariate extreme value regression modelling, while also performing variable selection
  to objectively determine the best model for a given dataset. This is achieved by using 
  generalized linear modelling for each parameter, and by fitting models with maximum 
  likelihood estimates.
